## 5.4	Run BillBuddyPaymentFeeder project
The BillBuddyPaymentFeeder application creates payments by randomly choosing a user, 
a merchant and an amount and performs the initial process of a payment. 
This includes deposit and withdrawal updates of each partyâ€™s balance appropriately. 
After the payment is initially processed it is written to the space for further processing. 
You will be further introduced with this application in a later lesson in greater detail. 
A new Payment is created every second.
 
5.4.1 Run the BillBuddyPaymentFeeder using Eclipse: 
Use the same instructions as used for the BillBuddyAcountFeeder.

5.4.2 Validate Payments were written to the space using gs-ui. 
You may choose to view Payment Objects using the Query operation of gs-ui.
 
5.4.3 Go to the statistics operation and see that a payment is actually added every second.
You might be required to modify the sample rate and start the automatic refresh.
