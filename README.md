##### Note 1 - Maven:

Maven versions &gt; 3.8 won't connect to non-https repos by default. Below is a workaround.

In ~/.m2/settings.xml, (if it doesn't exist, copy it from &lt;maven install directory&gt;/conf/settings.xml)

Add:
```xml
<mirror>
  <id>maven-default-http-blocker</id>
  <mirrorOf>external:http:*</mirrorOf>
  <name>Pseudo repository to mirror external repositories intially using HTTP.</name>
  <url>http://maven-repository.openspaces.org</url>
</mirror>
```
(There is already a section mirror. Modify the url and and comment out or remove blocked=true)

##### Note 2 - Downloading Gigaspaces jars:

Some corporate networks do not allow connecting directly to external Maven repositories. In this case, run:

`$GS_HOME/bin/gs maven install`

This will copy the GigaSpaces jars (bundled with your installation) to your local .m2 Maven repository.
